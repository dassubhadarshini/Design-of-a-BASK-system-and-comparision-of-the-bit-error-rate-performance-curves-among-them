    <h1>Design a BASK System: Voice and Image Transmission</h1>

    <p>In the realm of digital communication systems, efficient transmission and accurate reception of information are paramount. One of the fundamental techniques for digital modulation is <span class="highlight">Binary Amplitude Shift Keying (BASK)</span>, which offers a straightforward approach for encoding binary data into a carrier signal.</p>

    <p>This project aims to design a BASK system for transmitting both voice and image signals, and to compare the <span class="highlight">Bit Error Rate (BER)</span> performance of these two types of signals under various conditions.</p>

    <h2>Voice Signal Transmission</h2>
    <p>Voice signals, inherently analog, are digitized using techniques such as <span class="highlight">Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)</span> before transmission. The resulting binary stream is then modulated using BASK. The digitization process converts the continuous analog waveform into discrete binary data, which can be further modulated for transmission.</p>

    <h2>Image Signal Transmission</h2>
    <p>Image signals, which are typically already in digital form, are directly suitable for modulation after appropriate preprocessing. Both voice and image signals are subjected to BASK modulation, transmitted over a simulated communication channel, and demodulated at the receiver end.</p>

    <h2>Performance Evaluation</h2>
    <p>The performance evaluation of the BASK system will focus on the <span class="highlight">Bit Error Rate (BER)</span>, a critical metric indicating the number of bits received incorrectly due to noise, interference, and other impairments in the communication channel. By comparing the BER performance of the voice and image signals, we can gain insights into the robustness and efficiency of BASK modulation for different types of data.</p>
